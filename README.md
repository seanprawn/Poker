# Poker
Simple Poker application that shuffles a deck and prints out your hand

Instructions:

I used the build.xml generated by netbeans as the the script to build and compile and test and deploy the app.

In linux I simply run the command 'ant' in the folder with the script and it will build the app, compile into a jar file and run the tests in my test suite (with output).
Then simply navigate to the folder 'dist' and run the command 'java -jar SeanPoker.jar' and the app will run.
