# Poker
Simple Poker application that shuffles a deck and prints out your hand

Instructions:
-Please download the SeanPokerAssessment.zip file here and unzip it on your local machine.

I used the build.xml generated by netbeans, I modified it to run my unit tests and also modified netbeans to allow me to do this. 
 This script will build and compile and test and deploy the app.

-Main folder: SeanPoker (the build.xml is here)

-In linux terminal I simply navigate to the folder that contains the build.xml script, run the command 'ant', and it will build the app, compile into a jar file and   run the tests in my test suite (with output).

-Then simply navigate to the folder 'dist' and run the command 'java -jar SeanPoker.jar' and the app will run.
